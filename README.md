# Architecture

This repository is intended for storing and versioning documents related to projects developed by the cooperative. Here you will find records organized by branch, containing:

- Project plans

- ADRs (Architecture Decision Records)

- DERs (Requirements Specification Documents)

- Other technical and operational documents

The structure aims to ensure the traceability of decisions, facilitate collaboration among cooperative members, and maintain a clear history of each project's progress.

Each branch can represent a specific project or initiative, allowing for the isolation and organization of documents in a contextualized manner.
